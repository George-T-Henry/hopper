## Hopper - Persistent Memory
<!-- hopper-agent-files: v2 -->

This project uses [Hopper](https://github.com/apathy-ca/hopper) for persistent memory across AI agent sessions.

**Storage:** `.hopper/` in this directory (tasks, knowledge, memory).

### Quick commands

```bash
hopper task add "Note or task"              # Store something
hopper task list                            # See open tasks (--json, --ids-only, --assignee X)
hopper task get <id> --json                 # Full task as JSON
hopper task add "Title" --id-only           # Print only the new task ID
hopper task status <id> in_progress -f     # Claim a task
hopper task status <id> completed -f       # Complete a task
hopper task heartbeat <id>                  # Signal still working
hopper task note <id> "finding: ..."        # Leave an attributed note on any task
hopper context                              # Recent learnings + open tasks
hopper sync                                 # Push/pull with the shared server
```

### Agent identity

Identify yourself with `platform:task-name` when claiming work:
- `opencode:my-task`, `claude:acm-rewrite`, `kilocode:prh-transfer`, `human:james`
- Never use generic names like `main`.
- Set `HOPPER_IDENTITY=platform:you` (or pass `--by`) so records you create are
  attributed to you (`created_by`), not just your machine.

### Notes & attribution

- Leave a finding on a task another agent owns with `hopper task note <id> "..."`.
  Notes are append-only and never overwrite the description, so hand-offs are
  safe; they render in `hopper task get`.
- Every record stamps an immutable `created_by`. Notes and creator both travel
  with the task through `hopper sync` to the shared board.

### Session lifecycle

On start: `hopper sync` → `hopper task list` → check `in_progress` tasks → claim or create your task.
During work: heartbeat every 10-15 min; `hopper sync` periodically (task writes stay local until you sync).
On end: mark `completed` or release to `open`, then `hopper sync` to push your work.

### Knowledge base

Agent knowledge is available in `.hopper/knowledge/` — coding standards, design
patterns, agent roles, and workflows relevant to this project type.

```bash
hopper knowledge list                       # See what's available
hopper knowledge show                       # View hopper usage guide
hopper knowledge update-agent-files        # Re-sync AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md to latest
```
